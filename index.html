<p class = "bio">I am a sophomore at Dartmouth College with a passion for problem-solving, puzzles, and challenges. This passion has led me toward STEM fields and many late nights in the library surrounded by chocolate-covered espresso beans and a half dozen whiteboards. I also love collaborating with and learning from others, which has led me back over to social sciences such as psychology and sociology. As a scholar, I hope to continue to discover the vast and intricate ways in which people and tech can overlap and help each other to develop. As a coder, I hope to create products and resources that ultimately can change the world. And as a caffeine-newbie, I hope to one day wean myself off of those dangerously good chocolate-covered espresso beans.</p>

<p class = "bio">I have a passion for problem-solving, puzzles, and challenges which has led me towards STEM fields and many late nights in the library surrounded by chocolate-covered espresso beans and a half dozen whiteboards. I also, however, love collaborating with and learning from others. This has led me back over to social sciences such as psychology and sociology. As a scholar, I hope to always continue to discover the vast and intricate ways in which people and tech can overlap and help each other to develop. As a coder, I hope to create products and resources that ultimately can change the world. And as a caffeine-newbie, I hope I can wean myself off of those dangerously good chocolate-covered espresso beans by the end of my time in college.</p>
